Chef wants to prepare a Cook-Off contest with 5 problems chosen from a set of N problems. 
He has marked the difficulty of each problem within a range identified by one of the following strings: "cakewalk", "simple", "easy", "easy-medium", "medium", "medium-hard", 
"hard".
 According to this page, a Cook-Off contest must have problems of the following difficulties:

exactly one "cakewalk";
exactly one "simple";
exactly one "easy";
one "easy-medium" or one "medium";
one "medium-hard" or one "hard".
Given the information about the N problems, can you advise Chef if it's possible to pick 5 problems and form a valid Cook-Off contest?

-----------------------------------------------------

Check the frequency of each kind of difficulty and if it meets the criteria.

{
    map <string, int> difficulty_count;

    int no_of_problems;
    scanf("%d", &no_of_problems);

    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_problems; i++)
    {
        string difficulty;
        cin >> difficulty;

        difficulty_count[difficulty]++;
    }

    int possible_to_choose = (difficulty_count["simple"]) && (difficulty_count["cakewalk"]) && (difficulty_count["easy"]);
    possible_to_choose = possible_to_choose && (difficulty_count["easy-medium"] || difficulty_count["medium"]);
    possible_to_choose = possible_to_choose && (difficulty_count["medium-hard"] || difficulty_count["hard"]);

    printf("%s\n", possible_to_choose ? "Yes" : "No");
