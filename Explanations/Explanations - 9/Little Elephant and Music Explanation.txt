The optimal strategy is -

1. Listen to the shortest song of each band first.
2. After that listen to the other songs.

This is to ensure each l gets the best multiplier.

If there are n bands, the first n songs should be the shortest songs of each band. After that listen to the other bands. They will all have to be multiplied by n.
