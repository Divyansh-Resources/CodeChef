Chef wants to hire a new assistant. He published an advertisement regarding that in a newspaper. After seeing the advertisement, many candidates have applied for the job. 
Now chef wants to shortlist people for the interviews, so he gave all of them one problem which they must solve in order to get shortlisted.

The problem was : For a given positive integer N, what is the maximum sum of distinct numbers such that the Least Common Multiple of all these numbers is N.

Your friend Rupsa also applied for the job, but was unable to solve this problem and hence you've decided to help her out by writing a code for solving this problem.

-----------------------------------------------------

If N is the lcm of some numbers, then those numbers must be divisors of N. (Since N is their multiple).

We just have to sum over all the distinct divisors of N. Here is a O(sqrt(N)) solution - 

     for(i = 1; i*i <= number; i++)
        if(number%i == 0)
            sum_of_divisors += (i*i == number ? i : i + number/i);             //Divisors come in pairs(i, N/i) except the square root(i, i)
