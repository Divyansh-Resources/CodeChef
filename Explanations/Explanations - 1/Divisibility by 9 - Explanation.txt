Chef Zidane likes the number 9. He has a number N, and he wants to turn it into a multiple of 9. He cannot add or remove digits, and he can only change one digit at a time.
 The only allowed operation is to increment or decrement a digit by one, and doing this takes exactly one second. 
Note that he cannot increase a digit 9 or decrease a digit 0, and the resulting number must not contain any leading zeroes unless N has a single digit.

Chef Zidane wants to know the minimum amount of time (in seconds) needed to accomplish this. Please help him, before his kitchen gets overwhelmed with mist!

The first idea I got was to simply find the remainder with 9 and perform max{n(mod 9), 9 - n(mod 9)} operations. The first corresponds with subtractions and the other 
additions.

However, - 100000300000. Subtracting 3 and then 1 leads to a number with leading 0s.

An additional test needs to be performed - If The sum of digits is less than 9 and the number itself is greater than 9, then the answer is always 9 - n mod 9. 
Else it is max{n mod 9, 9 - n mod 9}
