Chef belongs to a very rich family which owns many gold mines. Today, he brought N gold coins and decided to form a triangle using these coins. Isn't it strange?

Chef has a unusual way of forming a triangle using gold coins, which is described as follows:

He puts 1 coin in the 1st row.
then puts 2 coins in the 2nd row.
then puts 3 coins in the 3rd row.
and so on as shown in the given figure.

Chef is interested in forming a triangle with maximum possible height using at most N coins. Can you tell him the maximum possible height of the triangle?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The question requires the index of the greatest triangular number T(i) <= n. 

Run a loop through the triangular numbers and break when the condition is broken. 
	If T(i) = n, then height is i
	Else T(i) > n, height is (i - 1)
