Professor Snape has lots of potions. Bottles containing all types of potions are stacked on shelves which cover the entire wall from floor to ceiling. 
Professor Snape has broken his bones several times while climbing the top shelf for retrieving a potion. He decided to get a ladder for him. But he has no time to visit 
Diagon Alley. So he instructed Ron Weasley to make a ladder for him. Professor Snape specifically wants a step ladder which looks like an inverted 'V' from side view.


Professor just mentioned two things before vanishing-

B - separation between left side (LS) and right side (RS) on the ground
LS - the length of left side
What should be the length of RS? At one extreme LS can be vertical and at other RS can be vertical. Ron is angry and confused. Since Harry is busy battling Voldemort, 
its your duty to help him find the minimum and maximum length of RS.

--------------------------------------------------------

The length of R is minimum when it is vertical and maximum when L is vertical. Pythagoreas' theorem should be used in either case.

Minimum - R^2 + b^2 = L^2
Maximum - L^2 + b ^2 = R^2
