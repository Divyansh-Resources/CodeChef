Alice and Bob play the following game.They choose a number N to play with.The runs are as follows : 

1.Bob plays first and the two players alternate. 

2.In his/her turn ,a player can subtract from N any prime number(including 1) less than N.The number thus obtained is the new N. 

3.The person who cannot make a move in his/her turn loses the game. 

Assuming both play optimally,who wins the game ?

n = 1, Player 2 wins

n = 2, Player 1 takes 1 and goes second on a n = 1 game (and wins)
n = 3, Player 1 takes 2 and goes second on a n = 1 game (and wins)
n = 4, Player 1 takes 3 and goes second on a n = 1 game (and wins)

Hypothesis - If n = 1 (mod 4), Player 2 wins
		 		Player 1 wins otherwise
		Let this be true for all n upto n = 4k + 1.

Induction : n = 4k + 2, 4k + 3, 4k + 4
		Player 1 takes 1, 2, 3 and goes second on n = 4k + 1 and wins by the induction hypothesis

		n = 4(k + 1) + 1, Player 1 can win only by reducing it to a game where n = 1(mod 4)
				The only way of doing that is by subtracting a multiple of 4 from n, which is neither prime nor 1.
		So, n = 4k + 1  is a losing position for Player 1 and Player 2 wins.
