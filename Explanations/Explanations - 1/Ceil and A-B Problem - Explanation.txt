In Ciel's restaurant, a waiter is training. Since the waiter isn't good at arithmetic, sometimes he gives guests wrong change. Ciel gives him a simple problem. 
What is A-B (A minus B) ?

Surprisingly, his answer is wrong. To be more precise, his answer has exactly one wrong digit. Can you imagine this? Can you make the same mistake in this problem?

------------------------------------------------------

Calculate Ans = A - B

Change the last digit of Ans.

It is sufficient to add 1 to Ans provided the last digit is not 9, else subtract 1.

(Ans mod 10) = 9, then Ans = Ans - 1, 
		  else Ans = Ans + 1
