In olden days finding square roots seemed to be difficult but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many languages .

Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance.

-----------------------------------

Didn't want to use an in-built function. So, just print the greatest number i, that satisfies i*i <= number


    int square_root = 1, number;
    scanf("%d",&number);

    while(square_root*square_root <= number)
        square_root++;

    square_root--;
    printf("%d\n",square_root);
