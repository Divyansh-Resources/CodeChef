The bitwise XOR of all the numbers gives the number that occurs an odd number of times. This is because - 

1. XOR(a, b) = XOR(b, a)

and

2. XOR(a, a) = 0

Use the commutativity to write all the same numbers one after another. All the even numbers cancel out and leave 0 at the end. The one which occurs an odd number of times
remains.
