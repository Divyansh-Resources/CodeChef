Now that Chef has finished baking and frosting his cupcakes, it's time to package them. Chef has N cupcakes, and needs to decide how many cupcakes to place in each package. 
Each package must contain the same number of cupcakes. Chef will choose an integer A between 1 and N, inclusive, and place exactly A cupcakes into each package. 
Chef makes as many packages as possible. 
Chef then gets to eat the remaining cupcakes. Chef enjoys eating cupcakes very much. Help Chef choose the package size A that will let him eat as many cupcakes as possible.

Given an N, find the number which gives the maximum remainder with N. Ceil(N/2) + 1 is the answer.

Case 1 : N is even. 

Firstly, no number can give a remainder greater than itself. So, N/2 + 1 is already greater than all numbers up to N/2. 

If N = 2m, N/2 + 1 gives a remainder = m - 1, All numbers after N/2 + 1 have to give a smaller remainder because the difference in between N and the number is less than 
m - 1

Case 2 - N is odd

N = 2m + 1, answer = m+1, 

All numbers smaller than m+1 must give a remainder smaller than m+1.
All numbers after m+1 cannot give m+1 as the remainder because m+1 > N-x, where x is any number in between m+1 and N. Adding m+1 to x will always exceed N.
