Grapes of Coderpur are very famous. Devu went to the market and saw that there were N people selling grapes. He didn’t like it because things were not very structured. 
So, he gave a task to Dhinwa to make things better. If Dhinwa successfully completes the task, Devu will be happy.

Devu wants to change the number of grapes in a bucket of zero or more sellers in such a way that the GCD of all the number of grapes is divisible by K. 
Dhinwa can add or remove any number of grapes from each of the buckets. Adding or removing a grape will be counted as an operation. 
Also after the operation, none of the seller’s bucket should be empty.

Help Dhinwa in finding the minimum number of operations needed to make Devu happy.

So, every number has to be made a multiple of k. We have to round it off to the nearest multiple of k. 

The answer is min(i%k, k - i%k)

Logically, I had overlooked the fact that the grapes can't be 0. So, if it's less than i, we have to round it off to k.

Computationally, there was an overflow error until the number of operations was long

    for(i = 1; i <= number_of_grapes; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &grapes_i);

        number_of_operations += ( k >= grapes_i ? (k - grapes_i) : min(grapes_i%k, (k - grapes_i%k) ) );
    }
