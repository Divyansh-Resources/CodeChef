Chef loves research! Now he is looking for subarray of maximal length with non-zero product.

Chef has an array A with N elements: A1, A2, ..., AN.

Subarray Aij of array A is elements from index i to index j: Ai, Ai+1, ..., Aj.

Product of subarray Aij is product of all its elements (from ith to jth).

----------------------------------------------------

The question is equivalent to asking the maximum length of a subarray without a 0, since any subsequence with 0 will have product 0 and vice versa.

    for(i = 1; i <= number_of_elements; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &number_i);

        length_of_current_non_zero_product = (number_i == 0 ? 0 : length_of_current_non_zero_product + 1);
        max_non_zero_product_length = max(max_non_zero_product_length, length_of_current_non_zero_product);
    }
