Since we're going through the array in ascending order, we only need to maximise product and rating when product is equal.

    for(i = 0; i < number_of_movies ; i++)
    {
        if(length[i]*rating[i] > deciding_factor || (length[i]*rating[i] == deciding_factor && rating[i] > rating[movie_chosen]))
        {
            deciding_factor = length[i]*rating[i];
            movie_chosen = i ;
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n",movie_chosen + 1);
