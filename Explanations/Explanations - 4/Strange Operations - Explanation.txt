Given an array consisting of N integers, you have to do the following operation K times.

Find out the sum of all the elements in the array. Denote it by S. Insert an integer in the array strictly greater than S. 
Hence, size of the array will increase by one.
Thus, at the end of the K operations, the array will have N + K elements. Find out the smallest possible value of the last number inserted in the array. 
Since this number can be very large, you just have to tell whether it will be odd or even.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's say the sum of the array is even. 

We must insert an odd number. Now, the sum is odd. Insert an even number. Sum remains odd, insert another even number and so on ...


Case 1: Array sum is even

	The first element inserted is even. All others are odd.

Case 2: Array sum is odd. 

	All inserted elements are even and don't change the sum.

   for(i = 1; i <= number_of_elements; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &number_i);
        parity_of_array = parity_of_array + number_i%2;
    }

    printf( parity_of_array%2 == 0 && number_of_operations == 1 ? "odd\n" : "even\n");
