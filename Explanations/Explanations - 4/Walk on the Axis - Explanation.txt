There are N+1 lights. Lights are placed at (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0) ... (N, 0). Initially all the lights are on. You want to turn off all of them one after one. 
You want to follow a special pattern in turning off the lights.

You will start at (0, 0). First, you walk to the right most light that is on, turn it off. Then you walk to the left most light that is on, turn it off. 
Then again to the right most light that is on and so on. You will stop after turning off all lights. 
You want to know how much distance you walked in the process. Note that distance between (a,0) and (b,0) is |a-b|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trick here is that (0,0) is not switched off right away. First walk till N, switch N off and then go back to 0.

After that the number of steps reduces by 1 each time. (Because we need to go one step short of where we came..)

N + (N + N-1 + N-2 + ... + 1) = N + N(N+1)/2

     number_of_steps = (number_of_lamps *1LL* (number_of_lamps + 1))/2 + number_of_lamps;
