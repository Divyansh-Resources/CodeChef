Chef has a sequence of N numbers. He like a sequence better if the sequence contains his favorite sequence as a substring.

Given the sequence and his favorite sequence(F) check whether the favorite sequence is contained in the sequence

     for(i = 0; i < length_of_sequence; i++)
     {
         if(sequence[i] == subsequence[subsequence_i])
         {
             subsequence_i++;
             if(subsequence_i == length_of_subsequence)
             {
                 subsequence_present = true;
                 break;
             }
         }
     }

     printf(subsequence_present ? "Yes\n" : "No\n");
