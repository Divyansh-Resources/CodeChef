The length of the maximum distinct character subsequence is the NUMBER of distinct characters ... Since, it only has lower case alphabets, the implementation was easy.

    for(i = 0; line[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        if(alphabet_present[line[i] - 'a'] == false)
            no_of_distinct_characters++;

        alphabet_present[line[i] - 'a'] = true;
    }

    printf("%d\n",no_of_distinct_characters);
