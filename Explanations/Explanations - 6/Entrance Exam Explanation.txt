The faculty of application management and consulting services (FAMCS) of the Berland State University (BSU) has always been popular among Berland's enrollees. 
This year, N students attended the entrance exams, but no more than K will enter the university. 
In order to decide who are these students, there are series of entrance exams. 
All the students with score strictly greater than at least (N-K) students' total score gets enrolled.
In total there are E entrance exams, in each of them one can score between 0 and M points, inclusively. 
The first E-1 exams had already been conducted, and now it's time for the last tribulation.
Sergey is the student who wants very hard to enter the university, so he had collected the information about the first E-1 from all N-1 enrollees (i.e., everyone except him).
 Of course, he knows his own scores as well.
In order to estimate his chances to enter the University after the last exam, Sergey went to a fortune teller. 
From the visit, he learnt about scores that everyone except him will get at the last exam. 
Now he wants to calculate the minimum score he needs to score in order to enter to the university. 
But now he's still very busy with minimizing the amount of change he gets in the shops, so he asks you to help him.

Logic was correct but I got an unexpected overflow error ...

If the total score of all students are placed in an array in descending array, then Sergey must score more than the k-th person.

However, if his score is already greater, than he must score at least 0. ... If he must score greater than M, then it is impossible.

The total score needs to be long long, as does Sergey's score ... If target score is not long long, it may cause overflow

target = max(0, T[k] - S + 1), It is possible that Target can be long long ...

If that is the case, then if overflow occurs, target may erronously be < M and the answer won't be impossible as expected (since M is always 32 bit).
