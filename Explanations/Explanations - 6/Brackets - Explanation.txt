A valid parentheses sequence is a non-empty string where each character is either '(' or ')', which satisfies the following constraint: 
You can find a way to repeat erasing adjacent pairs of parentheses '()' until it becomes empty. 
For example, '(())' and '()((()()))' are valid parentheses sequences, but ')()(' and '(()' are not. 
Mike has a valid parentheses sequence. He really likes everything about his sequence, except the fact that it is quite long. 
So Mike has recently decided that he will replace his parentheses sequence with a new one in the near future. But not every valid parentheses sequence will satisfy him. 
To help you understand his requirements we'll introduce the pseudocode of function F(S): 
	FUNCTION F( S - a valid parentheses sequence )
	BEGIN
		balance = 0
		max_balance = 0
		FOR index FROM 1 TO LENGTH(S)
		BEGIN
			if S[index] == '(' then balance = balance + 1
			if S[index] == ')' then balance = balance - 1
			max_balance = max( max_balance, balance )
		END
		RETURN max_balance
	END
In other words, F(S) is equal to the maximal balance over all prefixes of S. 
Let's denote A as Mike's current parentheses sequence, and B as a candidate for a new one. Mike is willing to replace A with B if F(A) is equal to F(B). 
He would also like to choose B with the minimal possible length amongst ones satisfying the previous condition. 
If there are several such strings with the minimal possible length, then Mike will choose the least one lexicographically, considering '(' to be less than ')'. 
Help Mike! 

-----------------------------------------------------

This is one of those questions that becomes easy once you understand it.

A string A is given. f(A) is defined to be the maximum number of unclosed brackets at any point of A.

We need to output B of minimum length ....

The minimal length string is 2*f(A) ... There must be atleast f(A) open brackets and at least that many closed brackets ... So, this is the minimal length.

We get string B by simply concatenating a string consisting of f(A) '(' and a string of f(A) ')'.

The balance of this string if f(A). This string is also lexicographically smallest and has the minimum length.
