Akhil has many balls of white and black colors. One day, he was playing with them. During the play, 
he arranged the balls into two rows both consisting of N number of balls. 
These two rows of balls are given to you in the form of strings X, Y. 
Both these string consist of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white colored ball and 'B' a black colored.

Other than these two rows of balls, Akhil has an infinite supply of extra balls of each color. he wants to create another row of N balls, Z in such a way that the 
sum of hamming distance between X and Z, and hamming distance between Y and Z is maximized.
-----------------------------------------

Apply the following strategy -

If both strings have the same letter, put the other letter. Distance will be 2.
If both strings have different letters, then put any letter in that position of Z. Distance will be 1 + 0 in either case. But, they want the lexicographically smaller one - B


    char ball_line_1[MAX_BALLS], ball_line_2[MAX_BALLS];
    int i;
    scanf("%s %s",ball_line_1, ball_line_2);

    for(i = 0; ball_line_1[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        if(ball_line_1[i] == ball_line_2[i])
        {
            if(ball_line_1[i] == 'W')
                printf("B");
            else
                printf("W");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("B"); 
        }
    }

    printf("\n");
