Bears love candies and games involving eating them. Limak and Bob play the following game. 
Limak eats 1 candy, then Bob eats 2 candies, then Limak eats 3 candies, then Bob eats 4 candies, and so on. Once someone can't eat what he is supposed to eat, he loses.

Limak can eat at most A candies in total (otherwise he would become sick), while Bob can eat at most B candies in total. Who will win the game? 
Print "Limak" or "Bob" accordingly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limak has eaten the sum of n odd numbers after n turns - this is n^2. ... Can be visualised by dots and squares or by adding an AP with symmetry.

Bob has eaten the sum of n even nunmbers after n turns = 2( 1 + 2 + ... + n) = n(n+1) = 2T_n

Find out the number of turns Limak can take and the number Bob can take. 

Limak wins if he can make more turns than Bob. If they can make the same number of turns, Bob wins. 

    //Limak has always eaten n^2 candies after n turns
    for(no_of_limak_turns = 0; no_of_limak_turns*no_of_limak_turns <= max_limak_candies; no_of_limak_turns++);

    no_of_limak_turns--;

    //Bob has eaten n(n+1) i.e. 2T_n candies after n turns
    for(no_of_bob_turns = 0; no_of_bob_turns*(no_of_bob_turns + 1) <= max_bob_candies; no_of_bob_turns++);

    printf(no_of_limak_turns > no_of_bob_turns ? "Limak\n" : "Bob\n");
