There are n people who want to take part in SnackDown. 
In the competition in this problem, a team should consist of exactly two people (as opposed to the real contest, where single-member teams are allowed). 
Of course, a person can only participate in a single team. Out of these, 2 * m people have already formed their teams, i.e. there are m teams already formed. 
The remaining people want to participate and make teams amongst themselves. 
Can you please tell whether it is possible to divide them into teams so that all the n people can participate?

m is irrelevant. All that matters is the parity of n. If n is odd, then teams can't be made.
