Today is chef's friend's birthday. He wants to give a gift to his friend. So he was desperately searching for some gift here and there.

Fortunately, he found an array a of size n lying around. The array contains positive integers. Chef's friend likes even numbers very much. 
So for the gift, chef will choose a consecutive non-empty segment of the array. The segment should contain exactly k even integers. 
Though it can have any number of odd integers.
He will then pick that segment and gift it to his friend.

But there is a problem. It might not be always possible for the chef to choose such a segment. Please tell whether it is possible for chef to select some gift or not?

I had overlooked a case. If k = 0, and all the numbers are even, Chef cannot give a gift. 

    for(i = 1; i <= number_of_numbers ; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &number_i);
        number_of_even_numbers += (number_i%2 == 0 ? 1 : 0);
    }

    //If k = 0, and all the numbers are even, Chef cannot give a gift
    printf(number_of_even_numbers >= k && !(k == 0 && number_of_even_numbers == number_of_numbers) ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");

or

   printf(number_of_even_numbers < k || (k == 0 && number_of_even_numbers == number_of_numbers) ? "NO\n" : "YES\n");
