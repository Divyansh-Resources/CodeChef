Snow Leopard has been given an integer ‘n’. Now he has to tell whether 2n can be written as a sum of two prime numbers or not.
Please help him calculate this efficiently.

------------------------------------------

Goldbach's conjecture has already been verified in the given range... Every even number other than 2 can be written as the sum of 2 primes.
Just check if n >= 2.

int main()
{
    int no_of_test_cases;
    scanf("%d", &no_of_test_cases);

    while(no_of_test_cases--)
    {
        int n;
        scanf("%d", &n);

        printf(n >= 2 ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
