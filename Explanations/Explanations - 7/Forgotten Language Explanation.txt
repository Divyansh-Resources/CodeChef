Forgotten languages (also known as extinct languages) are languages that are no longer in use. 
Such languages were, probably, widely used before and no one could have ever imagined that they will become extinct at some point. 
Unfortunately, that is what happened to them. On the happy side of things, a language may be dead, but some of its words may continue to be used in other languages. 
Using something called as the Internet, you have acquired a dictionary of N words of a forgotten language. Meanwhile, you also know K phrases used in modern languages. 
For each of the words of the forgotten language, your task is to determine whether the word is still in use in any of these K modern phrases or not. 

----------------------------------------------

I maintained a map of all words and their frequencies ... I was getting an error for a long time because I put () at the end of the map declaration ... It shouldn't be there


Check the frequencies of all forgotten words ... If the frequency of any particular word is more than 1, then it means it was used in at least one modern phrase.

------------------------------------------

    map <string, int> frequency;

    vector<string> forgotten_words(no_of_forgotten_words);
    for(int i = 0; i < no_of_forgotten_words; i++)
    {
        cin >> forgotten_words[i];
        frequency[forgotten_words[i]]  = 1;
    }


    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_phrases; i++)
    {
        int no_of_words_in_phrase;
        cin >> no_of_words_in_phrase;

        for(int words = 1; words <= no_of_words_in_phrase; words++)
        {
            string word;
            cin >> word;

            frequency[word]++;
        }

    }

    for(int word = 0; word < no_of_forgotten_words; word++)
    {
        string answer = "NO";

        if(frequency[forgotten_words[word]] > 1)
            answer = "YES";

        cout << answer << (word < no_of_forgotten_words - 1 ? " " : "\n");
    }

---------------------------------------

Also, if map finds a key value that isn't already inserted when using [] operator, it inserts it ...
