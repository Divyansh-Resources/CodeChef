Leha is playing a very interesting game. The game will be played on a rectangular grid consisting of N rows and M columns. Initially all the cells of the grid are uncolored.
 
Leha's initial score is zero. At each turn, he chooses some cell that is yet not colored, and colors that cell. 
The score obtained in this step will be number of neighboring colored cells of the cell that Leha colored in this step. 
Two cells are neighbors of each other if they share a side between them. The game will end when all the cells are colored. 
Finally, total score obtained at the end of the game will sum of score obtained in each turn.
Leha wants to know what maximum score he can get? Can you please help him in finding this out?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice what happens if you start at the bottom left corner and go from left to right in each row and colour all the rows ...

Except the first cell of the row, every cell gets one point because of the right neighbour.
Except the first cell of every column, every cell gets one point because of the down cell.

Points = m(n - 1) + n(m - 1)

But, how to prove that this is the optimal score ?

The proof is really beautiful and involves constructing a graph and noticing an invariant.

------------------------------------------------

    Draw a graph where the cells are vertices and an edge exists between every adjacent pair of cells.
    An edge is coloured whenever a cell is coloured and it's neighbour is already coloured.
    All edges are coloured only once and at the end of the game, every edge is coloured ! The order of colouring doesn't matter and the
    number of edges is the answer.

Number of edges = 2*Sum of degrees

Sum of degrees = 4*(n - 2)(m - 2) + 3*2*(n - 2 + m - 2) + 2*4 

Edges = 2*(n - 2)(m - 2) + 3*(n -2 + m - 2) + 4 = 2*mn - 4m - 4n + 8 + 3n + 3n -12 + 4

= 2mn -m -n = m(n - 1) + n(m - 1)

---------------------------------------

Of course, we can also accept the first counting as a valid proof after we have proven that the order of colouring doesn't matter.

max_score = 2*no_of_rows*no_of_columns - no_of_rows - no_of_columns;
