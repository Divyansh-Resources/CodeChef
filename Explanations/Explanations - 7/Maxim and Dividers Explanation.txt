Maxim likes dividers of the numbers. Also Maxim is fond of lucky numbers of small elephant from Lviv city. 
 
If you remember, lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky, 
5, 17, 467 — aren't. 
 
Now Maxim is interested in the next information: what is the number of the integer positive dividers of number n, which are overlucky. 
 
We call number overlucky if it is possible to remove some, but not all, digits and during bonding the remaining digits we will receive a lucky number. 
For example, number 72344 — overlucky, because it is possible to remove digits 2 and 3, and get number 744, which is lucky. 
Number 223 isn't overlucky.

---------------------------------------------------

Basically, a number is overlucky if it least one of it's digits is 4 or 7.

int is_overlucky(int n)
{
    while(n > 0)
    {
        if(n%10 == 4 || n%10 == 7)
            return true;

        n = n/10;
    }

    return false;
}

-------------------------------------------------------------

Now, get all the divisors of n in O(root(n)) time.

void solve()
{
    int number, overlucky_divisors = 0;
    scanf("%d", &number);

    for(int i = 1; i*i <= number; i++)
    {
        if(number%i == 0)
        {
            overlucky_divisors += (is_overlucky(i) == true);

            if(i*i != number)
                overlucky_divisors += (is_overlucky(number/i) == true);
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n", overlucky_divisors);
}
