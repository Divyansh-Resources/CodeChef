Isha and Suhana are on security patrol.

They start from a checkpoint and go in opposite direction for greater coverage.
Isha starts with speed U metre/second and Suhana starts with speed V metre/second. 
They both have a walkie-talkie, operating for maximum distance of X metres. How long will they be able to communicate ?

----------------------------------------------------

Floating point problems are always tricky. I didn't get AC when I used typecasting on the integers and multiplied them with 1.0.
Got AC when I made everything double.

void solve()
{
    double isha_speed, suhana_speed, maximum_distance;
    scanf("%lf %lf %lf", &isha_speed, &suhana_speed, &maximum_distance);

    double relative_speed = isha_speed + suhana_speed;

    double maximum_time = maximum_distance/relative_speed;

    printf("%lf\n", maximum_time);
